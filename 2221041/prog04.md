## Program 4 : Write a program to display operators in C.
```
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
int a= 15, b=14;
printf("A = %d\n B= %d\n\n",a,b);
printf("A + B = %d (Addition Operator)\n",a+b);
printf("A - B = %d (Subtraction  Operator)\n",a-b);
printf("A * B = %d (Multiplication Operator)\n",a*b);
printf("A / B = %d (Division Operator)\n",a/b);
printf("A mod B = %d (Remainder Operator)\n",a%b);
return 0;
}
```
```
Output: A = 15
 B= 14
A + B = 29 (Addition Operator)
A - B = 1 (Subtraction  Operator)
A * B = 210 (Multiplication Operator)
A / B = 1 (Division Operator)
A mod B = 1 (Remainder Operator)
```
